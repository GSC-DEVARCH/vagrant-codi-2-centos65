#+TITLE: CODI-2 - Development Environment
#+AUTHOR: Paul Massey

* Introduction

The following tools are included in this development environment. It
has the following main entry point - *[[http://localhost:8080/unifiedviews][Unified Views 2.1.3]]*. Other
tools which maybe accessible are:

- *[[http://localhost:8080/manager/html][Tomcat7 Management Page]]* ::
     
- *MySQL* ::
     
*Note:* 
- This environment does not contain virtuoso.
- Plugins available are taken from docker-unified-views dpus.zip
- Virtualbox Guest additions do not always work as expected.

* Development Security
The environment is intended as a disposable development evironment,
all development work should be placed in a source code repository:

- Files in /vagrant are shared with the host system, so backup of
  pipelines, etc. need to be moved there (or preferable saved using
  git, svn, etc.).

Vagrant VM's are intended as development environments (i.e. to be used
behind a firewall, etc.), they are *not* intended to be directly
connected to the internet, without changes to all the standard user
accounts, public passwords, etc.
