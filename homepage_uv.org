#+TITLE: CODI-2 - UnifiedViews DevEnv
#+OPTIONS: ^:nil
#+AUTHOR: Paul Massey

* Introduction

The following tools are included in this DevEnv once it has been fully
constructed for the unifiedviews installation:

- *[[http://localhost:8080/unifiedviews][Unified Views 2.3.0]]~* which is the main entry point to the
  UnifiedViews system.

- *[[http://localhost:8080/manager/html][Tomcat7 Management Page]]* 
     
- *MySQL* 
 
- [[file:homepage_orig.html][Installation Instructions]]

* Development Security
The environment is intended as a disposable development evironment,
all development work should be placed in a source code repository:

- Files in /vagrant are shared with the host system, so to backup
  pipelines, etc. the files need to be moved there (or preferable
  saved directly from this machine using git, svn, etc.).

- Vagrant VM's are intended as development environments (i.e. to be
  used behind a firewall, etc.), they are */not/* intended to be
  directly connected to the internet, without changes to all the
  standard user accounts, public passwords, etc.
